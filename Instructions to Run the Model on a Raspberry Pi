First, get into your Raspberry Pi with your computer. 

To run the model, follow these steps for now in the linux terminal.

cd examples/lite/examples/object_detection/raspberry_pi

The line above moves us into the directory that has the file necessary to run our model.

bash download.sh tmp

This downloads an example model and labels that we will be changing.

python3 detect_picamera.py \
   --model /tmp/final_model.tflite \
   --labels /tmp/coco_labels.txt

This is the line of code we use to deploy our model. Remember, for the model, we have to make a copy of “final_model.tflite” and put it in our “tmp” folder. Also, we have to change the labels in the “coco_labels.txt” to make it so that there is only one label, called “Mask Wearing.” We have to connect the Raspberry Pi to a TV or a monitor, and this should work fine. 

Notes: 
Make sure final_model.tflite is not a text file.
